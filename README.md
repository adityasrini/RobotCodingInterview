**Coding Interview Solution**

A few months back, I had a coding interview with a company in the Dulles Corridor of the DC Metro Area. I was asked to code a robot that could turn directions based on an input of a series of `R`'s and `L`'s and print out what direction it was pointing towards. As someone who hadn't done a lot of hard coding and thus hadn't had his algorithmic thinking honed in yet, I took about 40-50 mins to come up with what I had in the `WhatIDidInTheInterview` package! It was a disaster!

The folks who interviewed me were nice enough to tolerate this and encourage me to solve more problems and learn Java fundamentals more thoroughly. I took their advice to heart and spent the next few months off the job seeking process and on [docs.oracle.com](https://docs.oracle.com).

Out of curiosity I returned to solve the problem posed in the coding interview again. The interviewers told me that an experienced programmer would have come up with a solution within 10 minutes. This time, armed with a broader knowledge of Java 8, and having solved problems in [Project Euler](https://github.com/adityasrini/ProjectEuler) and [Reddit's r/DailyProgrammer](https://github.com/adityasrini/RedditDailyProgrammer), I got the whole solution done in **5 minutes**.

Suffice to say, I have come a long way and I'm proud of that! The package `FixedSolution` has my solution that takes in any combination and number of letters and responds to either capital or lowercase `r`'s and `l`'s and prints out the final pointing direction of the robot.
